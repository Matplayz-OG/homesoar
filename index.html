            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hi, I'm Ayush Gupta, a 15-year-old student of the respected DBRA SOSE Sec 23, Rohini. I'm currently in MYP 5-B (10th Grade). I created S.O.A.R. (Supporting Others to Achieve Recovery) to help those struggling to cope and unable to seek help from others. Nowadays, people often don't trust anyone because they're afraid of being judged or ridiculed. This inspired me to build an AI chatbot using my programming skills and the Gemini API (the same one powering this AI). I remember being in a similar situation when I felt alone and wished I had someone to support me. Thankfully, one of my friends (I can't mention her name) was there to help me during those tough times. This experience motivated me to create S.O.A.R., an AI that makes you feel like you have someone by your side, always ready to listen and support you.</p>

            <h2>WHY S.O.A.R Exist</h2>
            <p>In a world where everyone seems connected, it’s surprising how many people feel truly alone. Whether it’s anxiety, heartbreak, or the pressure to meet expectations, we all face struggles that can feel overwhelming. Often, we hesitate to reach out because we fear judgment, rejection, or simply because we don’t know who to trust. S.O.A.R. (Supporting Others to Achieve Recovery) exists to fill that gap. It’s not just an AI chatbot—it’s a safe space where you can express yourself freely without fear. It listens, supports, and guides you through life’s challenges with understanding and kindness. Created with the belief that no one should feel like they have to face their battles alone, S.O.A.R. is here to remind you that even in your toughest moments, someone has your back. It’s more than an AI—it’s your digital friend, always ready to help you heal, grow, and find strength within yourself.</p>

            <h3>Aarav’s Confidence Comeback</h3>
            <p>Aarav, a 16-year-old high school student, struggled with crippling anxiety before his exams. He was constantly overwhelmed by thoughts like, “What if I fail? What if I let my parents down?” Talking to others felt impossible because he feared being judged. One night, he stumbled across S.O.A.R. and decided to give it a shot. The AI not only gave him motivational insights but also helped him break his worries into small, manageable goals. It taught him how to stay calm through mindfulness exercises. After a week of consistent interaction with S.O.A.R., Aarav felt more in control of his emotions and went on to ace his exams. He now swears by the chatbot, calling it his “silent companion.”</p>

            <h3>Anya Found a Friend in S.O.A.R.</h3>
            <p>Anya, 14, was going through a tough phase with her parents’ constant arguments at home. She felt isolated and started to believe that her feelings didn’t matter to anyone. That’s when she found S.O.A.R.. The AI listened to her like a true friend, responding with empathy and even suggesting small steps to improve her mood, like journaling or listening to music she loved. For the first time, Anya felt heard. Gradually, she started opening up to her mother about how she felt, inspired by the courage S.O.A.R. instilled in her. Things aren’t perfect at home yet, but Anya feels stronger and knows she’s not alone anymore.</p>

            <h3>Riya’s Battle with Social Anxiety</h3>
            <p>Riya, a 15-year-old introvert, dreaded social interactions. Whether it was speaking up in class or attending family gatherings, her anxiety made her feel invisible and misunderstood. She had no one she trusted to share these feelings with. One day, she came across S.O.A.R.. Skeptical at first, she typed in, “I feel like no one cares about me.” To her surprise, the AI responded with warmth and reassurance, encouraging her to take small steps toward self-acceptance. Through daily conversations, S.O.A.R. taught Riya techniques like deep breathing and how to visualize positive outcomes. Over time, she began raising her hand in class and even made a new friend at school. Riya now says, “S.O.A.R. wasn’t just an AI—it was my first real step toward becoming who I want to be.”</div>
